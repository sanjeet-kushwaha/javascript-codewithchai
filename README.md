# javascript-codewithchai

This repo is containing the code I will write during learning and practicing Javascript. 

There is a lot to learn, I would like to make no mistake I have did in the past during the beginning of the leanring process of any new technologies. 

It would be good for me not to get hyped during learning anything new here. No matter how much you know, there is always an ocean to drink. Please don't kill your thirst after taking only few sips. 

Great things takes times. 

Stay tuned and keep learning.
